# Core MCP server dependencies
mcp>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
typing-extensions>=4.0.0

# No longer needed:
# - aiohttp (was for direct API calls)
# - aiofiles (filesystem operations handled by gemini-cli)
# 
# This MCP server now properly leverages the installed gemini-cli binary
# instead of bypassing it with direct API calls.
