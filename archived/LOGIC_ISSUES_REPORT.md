### Analysis of `src/main.py` and `src/gemini_cli_wrapper.py`

After a detailed review of the provided code, I have identified several potential issues ranging from minor robustness concerns to a critical logical flaw in the session management design. The implementation uses the `pexpect` library, which is a powerful choice for controlling terminal applications like the Gemini CLI, but its interaction logic has some fragile aspects.

Here is a breakdown of the findings:

---

### 1. `gemini_cli_wrapper.py` - Interaction Logic

This file is responsible for the low-level interaction with the Gemini CLI process.

*   **Potential Issue: Fragile Output Detection**
    *   **Description:** The `_read_response` method uses a fixed-duration silence (a 2-second timeout in `pexpect`) to determine when the Gemini CLI has finished sending its output.
    *   **Risk:** This is a common but potentially unreliable technique. If the AI is generating a long or complex response, it might pause for more than two seconds between output chunks. This would cause the method to terminate prematurely, returning a truncated or incomplete response to the user.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a more robust end-of-output detection mechanism. This could involve looking for a specific, consistent prompt pattern that only appears when the CLI is ready for new input, or using a more sophisticated state-tracking approach.

*   **Potential Issue: Hardcoded String Matching**
    *   **Description:** The methods `_wait_for_ready`, `_detect_auth_in_buffer`, and `_clean_response` all rely on matching specific strings or regular expressions (e.g., `'> .*', 'allow execution', 'Type your message'`).
    *   **Risk:** This makes the wrapper sensitive to changes in the Gemini CLI's user interface. Any update to the CLI that alters these prompts, even slightly, will break the server's ability to interact with it correctly.
    *   **Recommendation:** Externalize these patterns into a configuration file or a dedicated constants module. This would make it easier to update them without changing the core logic. Additionally, add more comprehensive error handling for when these patterns are not found.

### 2. `main.py` - Server and Session Management Logic

This file contains the high-level MCP server logic and manages the lifecycle of interactive sessions.

*   **Critical Issue: Conflicting Session Models**
    *   **Description:** The server implements two parallel and conflicting session management strategies.
        1.  **Multi-Session Model:** The `gemini_session_*` tools (e.g., `gemini_session_chat`) correctly use a dictionary (`self.interactive_sessions`) to create, manage, and isolate multiple distinct sessions. This is the intended and robust design for a multi-user environment.
        2.  **Singleton Session Model:** The `gemini_prompt` tool (and by extension, the `send_prompt_to_gemini` method in the wrapper) uses a *separate, single, shared* persistent session (`self.gemini_cli._persistent_session`). This session is created on the first call and reused for all subsequent calls to `gemini_prompt`, regardless of which user or client is making the request.
    *   **Risk:** This is a major logical flaw that will lead to unpredictable behavior and race conditions. For example:
        *   If User A calls `gemini_prompt` and includes a file, that file becomes part of the context for User B's unrelated call to `gemini_prompt`.
        *   The context from one user's prompt will leak into another's, leading to incorrect and confusing AI responses.
        *   It completely undermines the purpose of the multi-session architecture that the rest of the server is built upon.
    *   **Recommendation:** **This flaw should be addressed immediately.**
        *   **Option A (Preferred):** Remove the `gemini_prompt` tool entirely. Force all interactions to go through the explicit, isolated session model (`gemini_start_session` -> `gemini_session_chat`). This ensures predictability and context isolation.
        *   **Option B:** If a non-session-based prompt tool is required, it should be refactored to create a new, temporary `GeminiInteractiveSession` for each call and destroy it immediately after, ensuring no state is shared.

*   **Minor Issue: Unused `gemini_prompt` Parameters**
    *   **Description:** The `gemini_prompt` tool definition includes several parameters (`model`, `include_files`, `debug`, etc.) that are not actually used when calling `self.gemini_cli.send_prompt_to_gemini`. The underlying persistent session is started with default values, and these parameters are ignored.
    *   **Risk:** This is misleading to the user, who will assume these parameters are having an effect when they are not.
    *   **Recommendation:** This issue would be resolved by removing the `gemini_prompt` tool as recommended above.
