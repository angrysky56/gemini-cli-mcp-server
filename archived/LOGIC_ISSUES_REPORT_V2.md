### Re-analysis of `src/main.py` and `src/gemini_cli_wrapper.py`

I have re-analyzed the code after your edits. The most critical issue has been resolved, which significantly improves the server's stability and predictability. However, some of the more minor issues I pointed out in the last review still remain.

Here is an updated breakdown of the findings:

---

### 1. `gemini_cli_wrapper.py` - Interaction Logic

This file's core logic for interacting with the Gemini CLI process remains largely the same.

*   **Improved: More Patient Output Detection**
    *   **Change:** The `_read_response` method now has a much longer timeout (10 seconds of silence instead of 2).
    *   **Assessment:** This is a good improvement. It makes the server more robust and less likely to cut off responses from the AI, especially for complex tasks that require more processing time. While still not a perfect solution, it's a significant step in the right direction.

*   **Remaining Issue: Hardcoded String Matching**
    *   **Description:** The code still relies on matching specific strings (e.g., `'> .'`, `'Type your message'`) to understand the state of the Gemini CLI.
    *   **Risk:** As before, this makes the server vulnerable to breaking if the Gemini CLI's interface is updated.
    *   **Recommendation:** For future improvements, consider moving these patterns to a configuration file to make them easier to update.

### 2. `main.py` - Server and Session Management Logic

This file has seen the most significant and important changes.

*   **Resolved: Conflicting Session Models**
    *   **Change:** The `gemini_prompt` tool has been completely removed.
    *   **Assessment:** **This is an excellent fix.** By removing the problematic singleton session, you have eliminated the critical race condition and context-leaking issue. All interactions are now forced through the explicit, isolated session model (`gemini_start_session` -> `gemini_session_chat`), which is the correct and robust approach. This makes the server's behavior predictable and safe for concurrent use.

*   **Resolved: Unused `gemini_prompt` Parameters**
    *   **Change:** The `gemini_prompt` tool was removed.
    *   **Assessment:** This issue is now resolved as a side effect of the main fix.

### Overall Assessment

The server is now in a much better state. The removal of the conflicting session model was the most important change, and it has been handled correctly. The remaining issues are minor and relate to the long-term maintainability of the `pexpect`-based interaction logic.

The server should now be considered stable and reliable for its core purpose of providing persistent, isolated Gemini CLI sessions.
